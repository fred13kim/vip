Skills:
    - Operating System Concepts
    - RTOS
    - Unit Testing Framework
    - EEHW Concepts
    - Bootup sequence

3.
Tools:
    - C/C++
    - ESP-IDF DOCS
    - PCB Board Interfacing

4.
I know C, only have partial knowledge in how to read ESP-IDF Docs and a bit of O.S. concepts (taking O.S. class right now). 

5.
I do not have any knowledge on how the bootup sequence works with the PCB board. Not familiar in how unit tests work or how testing a board should be done. Any protocols?

6.
OS class with Hak definitely will help. ESP-IDF docs. Online resources on embedded systems & microcontroller boot process: https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/224156/how-does-a-microcontroller-boot-and-startup-step-by-step
